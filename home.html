						off-hours (with a few snacks for thought, too).</p>
		
					<p style="font-size:30px">After moving to the suburbs in May, I fully expected Halloween to be the worst craziest day 
					of my life. So my husband and I bought hundreds of individually-wrapped, bite-sized Reese’s cups, then stayed near the door for hours, bracing
					ourselves for a tidal wave of spooky ghosts and Ariana Grande dopplegängers.</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px">This particular style of pizza is said to have originated on Varadero Beach in Cuba, a popular holiday destination for many people on the island. Allegedly, the originator moved to Miami after the communist revolution and reopened his 
						famous pizzeria, Montes de Oca. Visit any of the handful of locations scattered across western Miami, and the sign will remind you that it is the original Cuban pizza.
						The founder of Rey Pizza, another local Cuban pizza chain, contests that claim. 
						Regardless of who you believe to be the true originator, most
						Miamians who are familiar with this style of pizza can agree that Montes
						de Oca and Rey Pizza are local institutions. But they aren’t the only Cuban pizzerias 
						in town.</p>
