        Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</p>
        <p>I adapted this reciepe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Grainger. Ever
            since tasting thee eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross,
            Sydney, I have been after the reciepe. I have since transformed it into what I really
            believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast";just look at the ingredients to see
            why. It has to be tasted.
        </p>
